# urban-transit-routes

Summary: I started a map in Mapbox Studio and found that the public transit representation was very lacking.
In order to include the public transit lines I had to import them into the platform myself.

For each city relevant to my map, I have been looking for data on these lines.
This repo serves as the notepad for these datasets.
